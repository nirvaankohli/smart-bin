    - Motors

      - Make the trash bin open
        - Motors
          - Links
            - Option 1: 
            - Option 2: 
          - Requirements
            - Motor needs to be compatable with Rasberry Pi
            - Motor needs to be powerful enough
            - Motor needs to be in a small form factor
            - Should be priced reasonably
        - Foot pedal mechanism for hands-free operation (human-powered backup)
    - Trash Bin

      - MVP
        - Body for Bin
          - Divider in the middle of the bin
          - Will be Cardboard 
          - Might change later on
        - Flaps(Prob Same as In Testing one)
      - In testing: Two cardboard flaps as bins
        - Easy to replace/modify for iterations
        - Cost-effective DIY solution for initial testing
        - Compartment for storing extra trash bags
        - Design flaps for easy access and durability
        - Sustainability aspect considered
